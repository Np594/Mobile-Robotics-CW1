# Mobile-Robotics-CW1
This Repository contains my mapping Drone simulation utilising path Planning and a LIDAR.
it is built upon a MATLAB tutorial by adding a battery which triggers a return to base behaviour when the battery falls too low. 
this also simulates a basic communication system updating base with current position, battery level and state, e.g mapping or returning to base.
Additionally LIDAR Noise is added to demonstrate the robustness of the drone
